## Tech Test For Nationwide

This project is broken to main folders, using Nest.js in the backend and react in the frontend. Both were created using their respective cli tools. Nest.js includes all the commands to start the server however docker will need to be started for Postgres using `docker compose up`.

There are quite a few things I would change if I had more time, I am happy to discuss in the interview. From a personal perspective my aim was to build a basic CRUD up application using Nest.js with a TypeORM to compare my usual approach of building from the ground as apposed to having it all pre-defined. I spent a quite a bit of time understanding GraphQL and especially how it linked with Nest.js, it was quite painful. That being said I can see a lot of potential in the Nest.js approach.
